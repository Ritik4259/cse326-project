      <h2 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Personal Finance Management</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Personal finance is a term that covers managing your money as well as saving and investing. It encompasses budgeting, banking, insurance, mortgages, investments, and retirement, tax, and estate planning. The term often refers to the entire industry that provides financial services to individuals and households and advises them about financial and investment opportunities. <br>
      Individual goals and desires—and a plan to fulfill those needs within your financial constraints—also impact how you approach the above items. To make the most of your income and savings, it’s essential to become financially savvy—it will help you distinguish between good and bad advice and make intelligent financial decisions. <br>
      Personal finance management encompasses the planning, budgeting, and execution of financial activities for individuals and families. It encompasses a wide range of topics, including income, spending, saving, debt management, investing, and retirement planning. Effective personal finance management can help individuals achieve their financial goals, such as buying a home, paying off their debts, or saving for retirement. It can also help them manage their finances in a way that reduces stress and uncertainty.</p>
